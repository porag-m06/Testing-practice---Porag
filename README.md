# Testing-practice-Porag (JEST)
## Coding Tasks Completed and Written Jest tests for : 

# Task 1
- Written a function stringLength(string) that takes any string as an argument and returns its characters count.
- Written a test for this function.
- Next, expanded your function to make it check if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters. Throw errors if those conditions are not met.
- Added tests for the new functionality.


# Task 2
- Written a function reverseString(string) function. It takes a string as an argument and returns it reversed.
- Written tests for this function.

- To group related tests and make output more readable used Jest's describe() method.

- Written a simple calculator object, which has 4 methods: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- Written 3 tests for each of the calculator methods.
- Grouped tests for each method using describe() method.


# Task 4
- In this task we Start by writing a test for a capitalize(string) function. The test made sure that this function takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
